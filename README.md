# PRODIGY_ML_03
Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.

**Overview:**
This project involves implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. 

**DATASET:**
The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

**Model Used:**
The SVM algorithm is employed for image classification in this project. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that separates data points into different classes by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.
